## Imaging Technique Inspiration

For the assignment, I was inspired by __Pop Art__. Pop art started in the 1960's and is best known for Andy Warhol's portraits of Marilyn Monroe.


This art form usually uses vibrant colors, such as red, blue, and yellow, to create a sense of visual impact, I plan to use a variety of contrasting colors in my project as well.

Also, the dots are often used in Pop Art as iconic element. For example, the pumpkins created by Yayoi Kusama uses many dots in different size. I think these dots have a unique charm to create the feeling of flow, and the repetition can bring a sense of satisfaction. In my project, I try to use repetition, not only with dots, but also with other elements.

Pop Art has the ability to transform ordinary elements into iconic works of art, which fits with the visual creativity of the assignment, and I think I can use this technique to make my project attractive and modern.

### Examples

## Coding Technique Exploration
I think the function __noise()__ can help me to create some repetitive but different elements for my project. It works by adjusting the values to generate a continuous pattern as well as a variety of shape changes. After creating the image, I plan to use noise to add textures to the elements of the project, which can be applied to the background or to the elements to create a layered and visually rich effect to the whole work.  

### Here are some examples of images created using this function.
